## Task 5 — API Routes (full-stack-developer)

**Date**: 2025-01-01

### Summary
Created four API routes for the steel traders application:

1. **`/api/inquiry` (POST)** — Accepts product inquiry submissions. Validates required fields (name, email, phone), maps snake_case request body fields to camelCase Prisma fields (productSlug, productTitle), and stores optional fields (company, quantity, message) as nullable values.

2. **`/api/contact` (POST)** — Accepts general contact form submissions. Validates required fields (name, email, message), stores optional fields (phone, subject) as nullable values.

3. **`/api/admin/data` (GET)** — Retrieves the latest 100 inquiries and 100 contacts from the database, ordered by creation date descending. Maps camelCase Prisma fields back to snake_case for the JSON response, and serializes Date fields to ISO strings.

4. **`/api/catalogue` (GET)** — Generates a PDF product catalogue using `pdf-lib`. Includes a cover page, table of contents, and per-category product pages with specifications. Imports product data from `@/lib/product-data`. Returns the PDF as a downloadable attachment.

### Files Created
- `src/app/api/inquiry/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/data/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/catalogue/route.ts`

### Notes
- All routes import `db` from `@/lib/db` (Prisma client).
- Lint passes with no errors.
- The catalogue route uses `fs` and `path` for reading product images from `public/`.

## Task 7-d — ProductsSection Component (full-stack-developer)

**Date**: 2025-01-01

### Summary
Created the `ProductsSection` component (`src/components/sections/ProductsSection.tsx`) — a "use client" component that handles both product listing and product detail views for OMKARA COMMERCIAL PVT. LTD. Uses an internal `selectedProduct` state (string | null) to toggle between the two views.

### Features Implemented

1. **Product Listing View** (when `selectedProduct` is null):
   - **Heading** — "Our Products" with total product count in subtitle.
   - **Two-column layout** — Sidebar (categories, `lg:w-64`) + main content area.
   - **Sidebar** — Category card with 8 entries: "All Products" (with total count) + 7 categories (MS Sheet, MS Plate, MS Beam, MS Channel, MS Angle, MS Round, MS Hollow Pipes), each with per-category product count. Active category highlighted with `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`. Initial active category set from `initialCategory` prop.
   - **Search input** — Filters products by title, description, or category name. Uses Search icon with `pl-9` padding.
   - **Product grid** — Responsive: 3 columns on xl, 2 on sm, 1 on mobile. Each card: category image (via `getProductImage` helper mapping category slug to `/ms-*.jpg`), Badge with category name, product title, description (`line-clamp-2`), and ArrowRight icon that appears on hover. Clicking a card sets `selectedProduct` to the product slug.
   - **Empty state** — "No products found matching your criteria." message when filtered list is empty.

2. **Product Detail View** (when `selectedProduct` is set):
   - **Back navigation** — "Back to Products" button with ArrowLeft icon that clears `selectedProduct`.
   - **Two-column layout** (`lg:grid-cols-3`): Left column (2/3) + right column (1/3).
   - **Left column**: Product image (16:9 aspect ratio), category Badge, product title (h1), description, specifications Card (2-column grid with `divide-x`, each spec as key-value row), action buttons (WhatsApp inquiry + Download spec sheet if `pdfUrl` exists).
   - **WhatsApp integration** — Pre-filled message with product title, description, and request for pricing/availability. Links to `wa.me/919123857784`.
   - **Right column** — Sticky "Request a Quote" Card with form fields: Full Name, Email, Phone (required), Company, Quantity, Message (optional). POSTs to `/api/inquiry` with snake_case fields. Shows loading state (Loader2 spinner) and success state (Check icon + "Quote Request Sent!" + "Send Another Request" button).

3. **Data source** — `allProductsList` built from `products` Record keys using `Object.entries(products).map(...)`. Category counts computed dynamically.

### Interface
```tsx
interface ProductsSectionProps {
  initialCategory?: string
}
```

### Files Created
- `src/components/sections/ProductsSection.tsx`

### Notes
- Exported as `export function ProductsSection({ initialCategory }: ProductsSectionProps)`.
- Uses shadcn/ui: `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `Badge`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Label`, `Button`.
- Uses lucide-react: `ArrowRight`, `ArrowLeft`, `Search`, `Loader2`, `Check`, `Download`, `MessageCircle`.
- Product images use Next.js `Image` component with `fill` for listing cards and explicit `width`/`height` for detail view.
- Lint passes with no errors.
- Dev server compiles successfully.
